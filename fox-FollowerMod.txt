Multi-Follower Spell Tome Learning
------
Implements simple multi-follower support, with spell tome learning and catch-up / teleporting.
Supports any follower (or animal) that uses the vanilla DialogueFollower system.

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
Requires SKSE: http://skse.silverlock.org/

[h1]Usage[/h1]
Recruit and otherwise use followers as normal. Currently, a maximum of 10 may be recruited.
Vanilla followers from an existing save will be "imported" automatically.

While in your party, followers can automatically use spells from any spell tome in their inventory.
To teach or un-teach spells, simply trade spell tomes with your follower.

To command all followers at once, hold your "Sprint" key while beginning dialogue with a follower.

[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
Fully supports animal followers too! (provided they use the vanilla DialogueFollower system)
If you attempt to recruit more than 10 followers, you will get a

Catch-up / teleporting is automatic, based on distance and line-of-sight.
When lagging behind, they will continually increase their SpeedMult until they catch up.
If too far, they will instead automatically teleport behind you, unless you're riding a mount.

Spell tome learning avoids manipulating any spells a follower already knows from vanilla.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't modify DialogueFollower or DialogueFollowerScript.

[h1]Uninstall Steps[/h1]
Dismiss all followers in your party (very important!), then remove the plugin as normal.
Optionally, use ReSaver (or similar) to remove any leftover references in your save:

Warning: If you don't dismiss all followers before removing the plugin, they will permanently remember any spells learned from spell tomes, and may be permanently stuck in a follow state. Please avoid doing this!

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]

I used the original Oblivion CSR for years, and can't imagine going back and playing Oblivion without it. The Skyrim version is pretty rad too, and deserves a mention!
