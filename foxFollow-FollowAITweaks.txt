Follower AI Tweaks
------
Implements a number of tweaks to allow for smoother AI following in large groups.

[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
Tweaks the following GMSTs:
[list][*]fAIMoveDistanceToRecalcFollowPath: 300.0000 -> 100.0000
	More responsive close-range following, matches vanilla fAIMoveDistanceToRecalcTravelToActor
[*]fBumpReactionSmallDelayTime: 1.0000 -> 0.2500
[*]fBumpReactionSmallWaitTimer: 3.0000 -> 0.7500
	More responsive "move away" behavior when bumping into AI
[*]fFollowerSpacingAtDoors: 200.0000 -> 96.0000
[*]fFollowMatchSpeedZoneWidth: 128.0000 -> 384.0000
[*]fFollowSlowdownZoneWidth: 150.0000 -> 96.0000
	Smoother close-range following (e.g. when walking)
[*]fFollowSpaceBetweenFollowers: 192.0000 -> 96.0000
	Much smoother following with 2 or more followers
[*]fSummonedCreatureMaxFollowDist: 400.0000 -> 320.0000
[*]fSummonedCreatureMinFollowDist: 250.0000 -> 192.0000
	Matches new PlayerFollwerPackage ranges below
[*]iNumberActorsAllowedToFollowPlayer: 6 -> 14[/list]
	Unsure, but MFSTL does allow 10 followers instead of 2, so bumped up by 8

Also tweaks PlayerFollowerPackage:
[list][*]Min Radius: 256.0000 -> 192.0000
[*]Max Radius: 384.0000 -> 320.0000
	Tighter following behavior
[*]Random conversations: False -> True
	Allows followers to chat with other NPCs like normal[/list]

The above tweaks primarily apply to recruited followers, and may or may not apply to quest followers on a case-by-case basis (they typically use all sorts of different AI packages).

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't also mess with follower AI.
(Specifically, anything that doesn't modify the above GMSTs or PlayerFollowerPackage)

[h1]Uninstall Steps[/h1]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.
