Spell: Write Spell Tome
------
Implements the ability to write spell tomes from equipped spells in exchange for a Dragon Soul.

[h1][u]Skyrim Special Edition Version[/u][/h1]
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26738

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
Requires SKSE: https://skse.silverlock.org

[h1]Usage[/h1]
Equip the Lesser Power "Write Spell Tome" in either hand, and a desired spell in the other hand.
After casting, the spell tome teaching that spell (if one exists) will appear in your inventory.

A Dragon Soul will be spent if a spell tome was successfully written; otherwise, nothing happens.

[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
Intended to be used with MFSTL to distribute otherwise unique, one-time spell tomes to followers:

However, this could just be used on its own if you otherwise had some use for writing spell tomes.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Currently, only vanilla spell tomes are supported. (Sorry, I don't own DLC for classic Skyrim!)
However, for the merge-savvy, the FLST of supported Books is "1foxFollowSpellTomeList".
Simply add any spell tomes you'd like this mod to support to this list.

[h1]Uninstall Steps[/h1]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.
