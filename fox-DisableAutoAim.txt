Simple plugin to disable archery auto-aiming.

Normally, Skyrim points your arrows toward an enemy near your crosshair.
This plugin simply sets the auto-aim angle for ranged weapons to zero, so arrows always point toward where you're actually aiming.

Skyrim Special Edition port by Lou the Lou: (thank you!)

(autoaim, auto aim, auto-aim, whatever)

Revision History:
r3:
-- Fixed the issue where follower commands (holding interact on your follower) wouldn't function, due to this plugin needlessly setting fAutoAimMaxDistance to 0. Credit for this fix goes to Ricochet Saw; check out his archery plugin here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=71452193

r2:
